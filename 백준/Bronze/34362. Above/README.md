### 문제 설명

<p>As a GPS hobbyist, you are interested in looking at how a database of altitude recordings will change to account for sea level rise. For your projections, you will assume that between now and $2050$, the sea level will rise by $30$ centimeters. Your input will be a single altitude entry from a database of geolocations (given in meters). You need to output what that altitude will be in $2050$, modified by your sea level rise projection.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>A single real number $-100\,000 \leq N \leq 100\,000$, representing a single altitude entry. The number contains at most $4$ digits after the decimal point.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print the predicted altitude in $2050$. Your output must be within $0.001$ of the correct answer to be accepted.</p>
