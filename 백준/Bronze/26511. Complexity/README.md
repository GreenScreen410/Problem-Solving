### 문제 설명

<p>Define the complexity of a string to be the number of distinct letters in it. For example, the string string has complexity 6 and the string letter has complexity 4.</p>

<p>You like strings which have complexity either 1 or 2. Your friend has given you a string and you want to turn it into a string that you like. You have a magic eraser which will delete one letter from any string. Compute the minimum number of times you will need to use the eraser to turn the string into a string with complexity at most 2.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input contains a positive integer n. Each of the following n lines contains a single string of at most 100 lowercase ASCII letters (‘a’-‘z’).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each input string print, on a single line, the minimum number of times you need to use the eraser.</p>
