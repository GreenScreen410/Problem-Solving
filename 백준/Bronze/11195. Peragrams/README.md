### 문제 설명

<p>Per recently learned about palindromes. Now he wants to tell us about it and also has more awesome scientific news to share with us.</p>

<p>“A palindrome is a word that is the same no matter whether you read it backward or forward”, Per recently said in an interview. He continued: “For example, add is not a palindrome, because reading it backwards gives dda and it’s actually not the same thing, you see. However, if we reorder the letters of the word, we can actually get a palindrome. Hence, we say that add is a Peragram, because it is an anagram of a palindrome”.</p>

<p>Per gives us a more formal definition of Peragrams: “Like I said, if a word is an anagram of at least one palindrome, we call it a Peragram. And recall that an anagram of a word w contains exactly the same letters as w, possibly in a different order.”</p>

<p>Given a string, find the minimum number of letters you have to remove from it, so that the string becomes a Peragram.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a string on a single line. The string will contain at least 1 and at most 1 000 characters. The string will only contain lowercase letters a-z.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output should consist of a single integer on a single line, the minimum number of characters that have to be removed from the string to make it a Peragram.</p>
