### 문제 설명

<p>At the start of every semester, Colorado School of Mines has a tradition of climbing to the top of lookout mountain so that freshmen can place a rock from their hometown onto the structure. Once the rocks are placed at the M, students cover them (and themselves) in white paint.</p>

<p>Mines' President Johnson is trying to plan the budget and wants an estimate for how much paint they need to buy. For the purposes of estimating, each rock requires exactly 1 liter of paint. Given the cost of a liter of paint and some number of rocks, how much money should be allocated in the budget?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer, $m$ ($0 \le m \le 1\,000$), representing the number of rocks brought to the M. The next line contains a single integer, $n$ ($0 \le n \le 1\,000$), representing the cost of a liter of paint in US dollars. The final line contains an integer, $y$ ($1873 \le y \le 3000$), representing the year the budget is for.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A single integer with the cost of buying all of the paint.</p>
