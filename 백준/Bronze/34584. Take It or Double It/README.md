### 문제 설명

<p>You are the host of a street experiment show called <strong>TOPC (Take Or Pass Challenge)</strong>. In the show, you approach people one by one and offer them some money. Each person can either:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Take it</strong>: Accept the money and end the game.</li>
<li><strong>Double it</strong>: Reject the money and ask you to double the amount and offer it to the next person.</li>
</ul>

<p>The game starts with $x$ dollars. You go down the street and meet <em>a random person</em>. You would like to predict in advance what each of them will say — either “take” or “double”.</p>

<p>You have a limited budget of $d$ dollars in your pocket. If, at any point, a person’s decision could result in an amount <strong>strictly greater</strong> than your available funds $d$, you must <strong>force the person to say “take it”</strong>, regardless of what they wanted to say. Taiwanese people are very kind-hearted, so whenever they have a choice, they would always say “double it” and pass the opportunity to others — unless they are forced to take the money.</p>

<p>Your task is to simulate the game and determine if the person you meet will take the money or double it and give it to the next person.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input contains two integers $x$ and $d$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a string “<code>take it</code>” or “<code>double it</code>”.</p>
