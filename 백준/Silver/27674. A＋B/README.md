### 문제 설명

<p>Our first problem today is as easy as <em>a</em> + <em>b</em>.</p>

<p>You are given a string of digits. Rearrange those digits to build two nonnegative integers <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> such that the sum <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> is as large as possible.</p>

<p>Each number must consist of at least one digit. Leading zeros are not allowed, but the number zero consisting of a single digit 0 is allowed. You have to use each digit exactly as many times as it occurs in the given input string.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input file contains an integer <em>t</em> specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line. Each test case consists of a single line containing one string of digits. If there are more than 2 digits in the string, not all of them are zeros.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output a single line with a single integer: the largest sum that can be achieved.</p>
