### 문제 설명

<p>Consider the set of all reduced fractions (rational numbers) between 0 and 1 inclusive with denominators less than or equal to N.</p>

<p>0/1 1/5 1/4 1/3 2/5 1/2 3/5 2/3 3/4 4/5 1/1</p>

<p>Write a program that, given an integer N between 1 and 500 inclusive, prints the total number of fractions, orders them, and prints a few of them to prove that your program can order them correctly.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The only line contains one integer, N.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>On the first line of the output, print the total number of fractions per the rules above. Subsequent lines should print every fraction from the ordered list, starting with the first fraction.</p>
